* **25.02.2014** Version 2014.1 released (sfepy.fem was split to separate
  FEM-specific and general modules, lower memory usage by creating active DOF
  connectivities directly from field connectivities, new handling of field and
  variable shapes, clean up: many obsolete modules were removed, all module
  names follow naming conventions , etc.), see :ref:`release notes
  <2013.4-2014.1>`.

* **22.11.2013** Version 2013.4 released (simplified quadrature definition,
  equation sequence solver, initial support for 'plate'
  integration/connectivity type, script for visualization of quadrature points
  and weights, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2013.3-2013.4>`.

* **18.09.2013** Version 2013.3 released (implementation of Mesh topology data
  structures in C, implementation of regions based on C Mesh, MultiProblem
  solver for conjugate solution of subproblems, new advanced examples
  (vibro-acoustics, Stokes flow with slip conditions), etc.), see :ref:`release
  notes <2013.2-2013.3>`.

* **22.05.2013** Version 2013.2 released (automatic testing of term calls (many
  terms fixed w.r.t. corner cases), new elastic contact plane term + example,
  translated low level base functions from Cython to C for reusability,
  improved gallery http://docs.sfepy.org/gallery/gallery, etc.), see
  :ref:`release notes <2013.1-2013.2>`.

* **27.02.2013** Version 2013.1 released (unified use of stationary and
  evolutionary solvers, new implicit adaptive time stepping solver, elements of
  set and nodes of set region selectors, simplified setting of variables data,
  etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2012.4-2013.1>`.
